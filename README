QuickSoundSwitch
Version 1.2 (2012-09-02)
Aaron Brooks (http://brooksaar.com/)

DESCRIPTION

QuickSoundSwitch is a System Tray app for Windows 7 that allows the user to easily change between default audio playback devices.

COMPILING

QuickSoundSwitch was written in C# for the .NET Framework (4.0), in Visual Studio 2010 Professional. QSS may compile using Visual Studio 2010 Express, but I haven't tested it. To compile, you will need to open the project in Visual Studio, make sure all the paths are correct for your environment, and build the solution.

CHANGELOG

1.2
- Added support for using a custom icon.

1.1
- Changed the way we display the current audio device in use. Instead of having a seperate entry displaying the current device, the current device will have a radio button style check mark next to it in the menu.

1.0
- Initial Release

KNOWN BUGS

- None... Yet.
